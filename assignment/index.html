      <h3 id="second" class="mode"> Above, I present you with the most in style way to get around in the 21st century. The one of a kind, orange gold plated Thunderbird PB Racer.
        What makes this mode of transportation so special, is its two toe seating front cab allowing you to ride solo like Justin Darulo. You hear me? Not to mention the fact that 
        its designed, made and shipped direct from the factories of Tys Toys, an American and certified company. Go, PB Racer, go!  </h3>
